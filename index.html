        Early life and television roles
        Yash was born on 8 January 1986 in Boovanahalli, a village in Hassan, Karnataka.[5][6] He was given two names: Naveen legally, and his mother's side of the family named him Yashwanth.[7][a] Yashwanth was chosen as they believed his time of birth astrologically necessitated a name beginning with the letter ಯ (ya).[9] <br><br>In keeping with a Hindu tradition of giving children a deity's epithet, Yash was described as Nanjundeshwara ("poison-drinker god", referring to Shiva).[9][10] Before starting his acting career, he was advised by others in the industry to adopt a stage name.[11] Desiring to stand out with a name that was unique for an actor in Karnataka, he shortened Yashwanth to Yash.[12]
        
        Yash's father, Arun Kumar Gowda, was a driver for the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation and later the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation. His mother, Pushpa, is a homemaker.[13][14] He has a younger sister, Nandini, who is married to a computer engineer.[14] Yash aspired to be an actor from a young age and actively participated in theatre and dance competitions at his school in Mysore.[13] When he was young, his family also ran a provision store, where he would help out regularly.[15] Yash wanted to quit school and pursue full-time acting after completing grade 10 but had to complete senior school on the demand of his parents.[13] He studied at the Mahajana Education Society for all his school years.[16] His parents initially disapproved of his acting ambitions, and his father wanted him to be a government officer.[15] In 2003, they relented and allowed him to move to Bangalore at the age of 16 to work on a film as an assistant director, but stated that he would not be allowed to go back if he returned.[13] The project was cancelled after only two days of filming, but Yash stayed in Bangalore.[13] He stated he had ₹300 (equivalent to ₹1,100 or US$13 in 2023) with him at the time.[15] He joined a theatre group, the Benaka drama troupe, which was formed by dramatist B. V. Karanth.[17] He worked as a backstage worker and was paid ₹50 (60¢ US) per day.[13]
        
        Yash eventually became a backup actor, and in 2004, portrayed Balarama, the lead role in a play.[13] While still working in theatre, he completed his Bachelor of Arts at Bangalore's K.L.E. College.[16] He made his television debut the same year with the teleserial Uttarayana.[14] In 2005, he was offered a role in the teleserial Nanda Gokula, where he starred alongside Radhika Pandit.[13] He went on to appear in several other teleserials such as T. N. Seetharam's Male Billu and Preeti Illada Mele.[14][13] Once Yash had secured a stable income, his parents moved in with him to Bangalore.[13] During this time, he was offered roles in seven films, but his insistence on having the script for each film made available to him was viewed as "arrogance from a newcomer" and often refused.[13]</p>
